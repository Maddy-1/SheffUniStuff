<h2>A return to the start of time</h2>


<p>Once upon a time, Maddy was incapable of saying no and then ended up in a strange building with strange people, doing strange things. 
The outcome was a very confused being and some circles.</p>

revisiting the very beginning of Maddy's trauma with webdev.</p>
